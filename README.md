# COVID-19-case-growth-by-country
This repository has two scripts. The first creates a graph of confirmed COVID-19 cases by country since the first confirmed case in that country. The other graphs active cases by date. Both create labels for the 10 countries and export an A4 sized JPEG image of the graph. The labels, titles, and file names are parametricized so that it can be run daily and everyting updates. The data is from the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
